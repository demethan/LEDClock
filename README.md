# LEDClock
LED Analogue clock

3D printed clock where LEDs will display the time in analogue format. 

-The clock will be double sided and wall mounted (similar to hospital hallway clocks)  
-There will be 60 LEDs per side for the minutes  
-There will be 12 LEDs per side for the hours  
-The LEDs will be driver by a multiplexer per side.  
-The LEDs will be driven like a matrix  
-The processing will be an NetDuino (because that is what I have) or a Arduino Uno WIFI  
-The clock program will sync to NTP and will switch autmatically for DST
