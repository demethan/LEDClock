LED Analogue clock

3D printed clock where LED will display the time in analogue format. 

-The clock will be double sided and wall mount (similar to hospital hallway clocks)  
-there will be 60 LEDs per side for the minutes  
-there will be 12 LEDs per side for the hours  
-the LEDs will be driver by a multiplexer per side.  
-the LEDs will be driven like a matrix  
-the processing will be an NetDuino (because that is what I have) or a Arduino Uno WIFI  
-the clock program will sync to NTP and will switch autmatically for DST
